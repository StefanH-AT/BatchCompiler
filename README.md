# Batch Compiler

This program is a GUI tool that makes it easy to compile many source engine maps in bulk.

## Why use a batch compiler?

Mod authors have to juggle many different maps at once.
Using hammer's in-built compiler is fine during development, but when multiple people work on different maps, it can be a pain to compile each map individually, especially when compile times can take tens of minutes.

This tool provides a simple interface to compile multiple maps at once. It can be used to compile maps in the background while you work on other things or to compile maps over night when you're not using your computer.

The command line interface also makes it easy to embed this tool into automated build systems.
